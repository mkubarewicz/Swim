            <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 by <a href="#">Maggie</a></p>

            <p>Sometimes public pools aren't that fun. More later. If people just learned to splash less. Splashing makes you go slower.
			   Splashing also gets us wet. Sometimes we don't want a mouthful of water that came from your feet. Not that your feet aren't
			   nice. It's just sometimes air is where air should go and water is where water should go. This will be coherent at a later 
			   time. Maybe. Probably. Most likely?</p>

            <p>Talking, talking, example. GOES ON MORE. Bubbles are where air is inside water, but not always because sometimes something
				else that might make sense is there. But really none of this makes sense. I'm just making a wall of text so I can decide
				on formatting, but I didn't want to speak in Latin since almost no one reads Latin. What if someone got bored and wanted
				to read what this says? I don't know why anyone would do that. That would be a crazy thing to do. But sometimes people are
				strange. And that's okay.</p>

            <p>One day I will be better at blogging. But not today. Today is not blog day. Today is design day. BACK TO DESIGNING NOW.
				No wait, this post is too small. How will I know what it looks like? I want it to be a real post's size. But I don't 
				think I can write that much nonsense right now. Usually I'm better at writing nonsense than this. But today I just feel
				tired. Today I went swimming. But I kind of regret it. Because now I am sore. And that is what happens when you swim.
				Plus my ears are filled with water. And my nose. And my eyes are red. And I keep sneezing everywhere. I think I'm allergic
				to pools. How saddening.</p>

            <p>This blog is dedicated to Maggie and Karen's adventures in swimming. Maggie has been swimming since she was a little girl and used 
			   to swim competitively (VERY SLOWLY). Karen's perspective is from someone newer to swimming. They talk to each other about the weird
			   events in the pool. Such as texting. Texting and swimming do not mix. Do not do it.</p>
